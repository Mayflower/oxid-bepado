#Mayflower OXID-Bepado-Module

This repository contains a module-extension for the **OXID eShop Community Edition v4.9** 
by [OXID eSales](https://www.oxid-esales.com/).

Its purpose is to connect your OXID shop to the *Bepado* network and hence enabling you to 
offer imported products from remote shops to top off your range of products. Your customer will 
have the experience of ordering his/her products in your shop while this module and *Bepado* will 
handle the transaction concerning remote products with no inconvenience to yourself as shop owner.

Accordingly you can export your products to *Bepado* so other shops can sell them and hence 
enlarging your pool of customers.


For further information about the *Bepado* network go to http://info.bepado.de/ (german site).
