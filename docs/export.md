# Export your products to Bepado

With the Mayflower OXID-Bepado-module it is possible for you to export your products from the *Bepado* network so other 
shops may take them into their range of products. Bepado will take care of relaying the order to you if your product is 
ordered by a customer of another shop. Hence you can easily enlarge your customer base through third-party-shops. 

This document will show you, how it's done.


## Choose products for export

To export one of your products to *Bepado* you have to go to your OXID shops admin panel to the product menue. Select 
the article you want to export and go to the extended tab. On the right hand site you'll find the *Bepado* settings.

Check the box, save your changes and Bepado will know that you want to export this article. You were successful if the 
article is marked in the article list with this little icon:
![export-icon](img/bepado_out.png?raw=true) 

*Note:* The article list doesn't refesh directly in OXID. So perhaps you have to refresh the page to see the icon.


## Release the product to Bepado

If you exported products in your OXID shop, you can go to the *Bepado* networt site. It may take a bit for Bepado to 
load your exported articles and don't worry if there are no images to be seen. Bepado will load them but it can take 
a while. 

As soon as your products are loaded you can check if all properties are right and release the articles. No other shop 
owners can find you products and import them to their shops.
