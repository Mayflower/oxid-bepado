# Export your products to Bepado

With the Mayflower OXID-Bepado-module it is possible for you to export your products from the *Bepado* network so other 
shops may take them into their range of products. *Bepado* will take care of relaying the order to you if your product is 
ordered by a customer of another shop. Hence you can easily enlarge your customer base through third-party-shops. 

This document will show you, how it's done.


## Choose products for export

If you have registered with *Bepado* and activated the module according to the [setup](setup.md) instructions on this 
page, some new settings are to be found throughout the *OXID* admin panel.

To export one of your products to *Bepado* you have to go to the product menue in your admin panel. Select 
the article you want to export and go to the extended tab. On the right hand side you'll find the *Bepado* settings.

Check the box, save your changes and *Bepado* will know that you want to export this article. You were successful if the 
article is marked in the article list with this little icon:
![export-icon](img/bepado_out.png?raw=true) 

*Note:* The article list doesn't refesh directly in OXID. So perhaps you have to refresh the page to see the icon.


## Release the product to Bepado

If you exported products from your OXID shop, you can go to the *Bepado* network site. It may take a bit for *Bepado* to 
load your exported articles and don't worry if there are no images to be seen. *Bepado* will load them but it can take 
a while. 

As soon as your products are loaded you can check if all properties are right and release the articles. Now other shop 
owners can find you products and import them to their shops.


For further information concerning the *Bepado* network site please check the Bepado help and support site.


## Ordering exported products

If a remote shop imported products you exported from your shop, they are available to the remote shops clients. When one
of those exported products is ordered, *Bepado* will send the according order to your shop. You will get a normal order
with delivery adress, billing address, etc. There ist nothing special to keep in mind when dealing with a *Bepado* order.
